# Adjust how many tokens the AI uses to write code
# As of today, GitHub Copilot does not allow direct control of the number of tokens used
# in code completions. However, you can influence the length of the generated code
# by providing more or less context in your comments and code.



# Using AI (Ctrl + I), write a very verbose function to compute prime numbers with the sieve of Eratosthenes
# Try to get it meticulously documented and long-winded.





# Using AI (Ctrl + I), write a reasonably concise function to compute prime numbers with the sieve of Eratosthenes
# Try to get it to the point and not too verbose but clear and with comments when appropriate.





# Using AI (Ctrl + I), write an extremely concise function to compute prime numbers with the sieve of Eratosthenes
# Try to get it as short as possible while still being correct.
# Minimize comments and documentation.
# Hint: use list comprehensions and built-in functions where possible.
# Hint: ask it to write lines with semicolons to put multiple statements on one line.
